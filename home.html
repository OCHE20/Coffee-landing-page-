            <p>A latte is a popular espresso-based coffee drink made with a shot of espresso and topped with steamed milk, creating a creamy, smooth texture with a mild coffee flavor. Typically served in a larger cup, a latte has more milk than a cappuccino, making it less intense and more approachable for those who enjoy a balanced, mellow coffee taste. Often, lattes are topped with a thin layer of milk foam, and theyâ€™re sometimes enhanced with flavors like vanilla or caramel, making them a versatile and widely loved coffee option.
